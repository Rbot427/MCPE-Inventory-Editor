TO EDIT MUTIPLE WORLDS

Delete the level.dat files (like the level.dat.copy and the level.dat.bak)

Drag the level.dat that you want to edit into the same folder as you used to start this program

Launch the MCPE Inventory Editor and you will be good!

ATTENTION!

When you type in the block name, YOU CAN'T PUT A SPACE

For example, 

Diamond Block would be DiamondBlock
